# ⒹⒹⒹ➌itheredSlitScan

A processing project that outputs dithered slit scan images for @bakkenbaeck's DDD3 event in Amsterdam. This is used in sync with [DDD3-Server](https://github.com/rensverschuren/ddd3-server) :)

The final outcome is a photo-booth like installation where guests in the event took slitscan photos of themselves (and friends) which went straight to print with a thermal receipt printer.

Made possible by @bakkenbaeck, @luukjanssens, @abrilmagenta, @rensverschuren
